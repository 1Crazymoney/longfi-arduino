# ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 - Button to AWS Example

This is an example code for building an AWS IoT application that sends you text messages using Twilio.

You'll need:
* ST-B-L072Z-LRWAN1
* An AWS account
* A Twilio account

You need to load this sketch onto the ST-B-L072Z-LRWAN1. The sketch will send a heartbeat every 15 seconds and will asyncronously send an alert whenever the button is pressed.

Once you confirm that the device is connecting and sending data via Helium Console, you'll want to setup an integration to AWS IoT.

Once you do that, you want to create a Lambda function using the Python file here: lambda_button_text.py

You'll need to set environmental variables to make it work:
* TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: get this from your Twilio dashboard
* TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: get this from your Twilio dashboard	
* TWILIO_ASSIGNED_NUMBER: get this from your Twilio dashboard	
* USER_NUMBERâ€¬: this is the cell phone number which will get text message alerts when the button is pressed

Once you save the lambda function, you will simply need to connect the lambda function to an AWS IoT trigger. Use the rule query statement: SELECT * FROM "helium"

Now you're done! Press the button and you should get a text message.
